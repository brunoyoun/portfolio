This is the first ever independent analysis in which I have used sklearn.

I could have simply used the Titanic or iris datasets, but I wanted to take a road less travelled.
Because I hail from southern California, I chose a dataset that reflected a large part of my life.

I resorted to some elaborate data cleaning procedures to get rid of rows of data that referred to the same point in time.
