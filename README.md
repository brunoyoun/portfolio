# portfolio
This is my data science portfolio. At this writing, it contains two small projects: 
1. One graph that I created in matplotlib, plus the accompanying data. The graph displays the average amount of recreational physical activity by income bracket, using data taken from the NHANES survey.
2. An exploratory analysis of traffic data from a westbound stretch of the I-94 between Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota. Testing of different algorithms to predict traffic volume is in progress as of July 30, 2019.
